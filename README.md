# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Logistic-Regression
This project, based on the Django framework, contains a simple form in which there is a field to post reviews and a logistic system to analyze that review and classify it into positive and negative sentiments. The posts or reviews are listed in the table which can be edited and deleted. The sentiment changes as well after editing.
